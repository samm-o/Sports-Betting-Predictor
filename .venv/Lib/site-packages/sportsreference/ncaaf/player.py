class AbstractPlayer:
    """
    Get player information and stats for all seasons.

    Given a player ID, such as 'david-blough-1' for David Blough, capture all
    relevant stats and information like name, team, height/weight, career
    starts, single season pasing yards, sacks, and much more.

    By default, the class instance will return the player's career stats, but
    single-season stats can be found by calling the instance with the requested
    season as denoted on sports-reference.com.

    Parameters
    ----------
    player_id : string
        A player's ID according to sports-reference.com, such as
        'david-blough-1' for David Blough. The player ID can be found by
        navigating to the player's stats page and getting the string between
        the final slash and the '.html' in the URL. In general, the ID is in
        the format 'first-last-n' where 'first' is the player's first name in
        lowercase, 'last' is the player's last name in lowercase, and 'n' is a
        number starting at '1' for the first time that player ID has been used
        and increments by 1 for every successive player.
    player_name : string
        A string representing the player's first and last name, such as 'David
        Blough'.
    player_data : string
        A string representation of the player's HTML data from the Boxscore
        page. If the player appears in multiple tables, all of their
        information will appear in one single string concatenated together.
