def _find_year_for_season(league):
    """
    Return the necessary seaons's year based on the current date.

    Since all sports start and end at different times throughout the year,
    simply using the current year is not sufficient to describe a season. For
    example, the NCAA Men's Basketball season begins in November every year.
    However, for the November and December months, the following year is used
    to denote the season (ie. November 2017 marks the start of the '2018'
    season) on sports-reference.com. This rule does not apply to all sports.
    Baseball begins and ends in one single calendar year, so the year never
    needs to be incremented.

    Additionally, since information for future seasons is generally not
    finalized until a month before the season begins, the year will default to
    the most recent season until the month prior to the season start date. For
    example, the 2018 MLB season begins in April. In January 2018, however, not
    all of the season's information is present in the system, so the default
    year will be '2017'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    league : string
        A string pertaining to the league start information as listed in
        SEASON_START_MONTH (ie. 'mlb', 'nba', 'nfl', etc.). League must be
        present in SEASON_START_MONTH.

    Returns a team's abbreviation.

    A school or team's abbreviation is generally embedded in a URI link which

    New England Patriots for the 2017 season is "/teams/nwe/2017.htm". This

    Parse an HTML table to find the requested field's value.

    All of the values are passed in an HTML table row instead of as individual
    items. The values need to be parsed by matching the requested attribute
    with a parsing scheme that sports-reference uses to differentiate stats.
    This function returns a single value for the given attribute.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parsing_scheme : dict
        A dictionary of the parsing scheme to be used to find the desired
        field. The key corresponds to the attribute name to parse, and the
        value is a PyQuery-readable parsing scheme as a string (such as
        'td[data-stat="wins"]').
    html_data : string
        A string containing all of the rows of stats for a given team. If
        multiple tables are being referenced, this will be comprised of
        multiple rows in a single string.
    field : string
        The name of the attribute to match. Field must be a key in
        parsing_scheme.
    index : int (optional)
        An optional index if multiple fields have the same attribute name. For
        example, 'HR' may stand for the number of home runs a baseball team has
        hit, or the number of home runs a pitcher has given up. The index
        aligns with the order in which the attributes are recevied in the
        html_data parameter.
    strip : boolean (optional)
        An optional boolean value which will remove any empty or invalid
        elements which might show up during list comprehensions. Specify True
        if the invalid elements should be removed from lists, which can help
        with reverse indexing.
    secondary_index : int (optional)
        An optional index if multiple fields have the same attribute, but the
        original index specified above doesn't work. This happens if a page
        doesn't have all of the intended information, and the requested index
        isn't valid, causing the value to be None. Instead, a secondary index
        could be checked prior to returning None.

        The value at the specified index for the requested field. If no value
