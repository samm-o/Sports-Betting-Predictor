class Team:
    """
    An object containing all of a team's season information.

    Finds and parses all team stat information and identifiers, such as full
    and short names, and sets them as properties which can be directly read
    from for easy reference.

    If calling directly, the team's abbreviation needs to be passed. Otherwise,
    the Teams class will handle all arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    team_name : string (optional)
        The name of the team to pull if being called directly.
    team_data : string (optional)
        A string containing all of the rows of stats for a given team. If
        multiple tables are being referenced, this will be comprised of
        multiple rows in a single string.
    team_conference : string (optional)
        A string of the team's conference abbreviation, such as 'big-12'.
    year : string (optional)
        The requested year to pull stats from.
    basic_stats : string (optional)
        Optionally specify the filename of a local file to use to pull data
        instead of downloading from sports-reference.com. This file should be
        of the Basic Stats page for the designated year.
    basic_opp_stats : string (optional)
        Optionally specify the filename of a local file to use to pull data
        instead of downloading from sports-reference.com. This file should be
        of the Basic Opponent Stats page for the designated year.
    adv_stats : string (optional)
        Optionally specify the filename of a local file to use to pull data
        instead of downloading from sports-reference.com. This file should be
        of the Advanced Stats page for the designated year.

        instead of downloading from sports-reference.com. This file should be
