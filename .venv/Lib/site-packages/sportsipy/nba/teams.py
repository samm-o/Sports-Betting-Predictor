class Team:
    """
    An object containing all of a team's season information.

    Finds and parses all team stat information and identifiers, such as rank,
    name, and abbreviation, and sets them as properties which can be directly
    read from for easy reference.

    If calling directly, the team's abbreviation needs to be passed. Otherwise,
    the Teams class will handle all arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    team_name : string (optional)
        The name of the team to pull if being called directly.
    team_data : string (optional)
        A string containing all of the rows of stats for a given team. If
        multiple tables are being referenced, this will be comprised of
        multiple rows in a single string. Is only used when called directly
        from the Teams class.
    rank : int (optional)
        A team's position in the league based on the number of points they
        obtained during the season. Is only used when called directly from the
        Teams class.
    year : string (optional)
        The requested year to pull stats from.
    season_file : string (optional)
        Optionally specify the filename of a local file to use to pull data
        instead of downloading from sports-reference.com. This file should be
        of the Season page for the designated year.
